<h4></h4>
I wanted to start my first post of this blog with a fun little project on a topic that I am interested in, movies. I did not have a lot of time in the past year to watch many movies. So I thought I would do some data exploration to see what were the top movies of 2015.

This project was meant to be a short project for me to practice web-scraping in python. The data was obtained from the website <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/">the-numbers</a>. They have a nice database of movie information including budgets and box office earnings. They also provide a detailed analysis of the data, so check them out if you are interested.

Before getting right into the data, there is a little disclaimer. I used this dataset <em>as is</em> for a web-scraping practice and to extract some interesting findings from it. The dataset is not meant to be a comprehensive list of information of all movies. It only includes movies where the financial information was available, which is a total of 190 movies.
<h2>Top Earners</h2>
First, we can quickly look at the movies with the top box office earnings for the year. After all, there were a few movies in 2015 that made it to the  all-time top Box Office worldwide gross (not accounting for inflation).

Top 5 movies with the highest worldwide gross:

It is probably not surprising that the top grossing movies were all high-profile action movies. After all we might expect that movies with larger budgets are likely to earn more.
<h2>Gross and Budget</h2>
So is it true that movies with larger budgets generally do better in the box office? Let's take a look at the data grouped by genre.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-109" src="https://nnvutisa.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/grossbudget.png" alt="GrossBudget" width="741" height="648" />

There is a lot of scatter in the plot, but the correlation was tighter for large budget movies. There are also some notable differences between genre. Horror movies in particular did quite well in the box office. To look at each genre more closely, we can look at how they did on average. For this purpose, I combined several categories together to look at their statistics and only included the categories with number of data points > 30 (1).

<img class="  wp-image-111 aligncenter" src="https://nnvutisa.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/grossbudget_box.png" alt="GrossBudget_box" width="650" height="587" />

Thriller/Horror genre did the best in worldwide box office compared to the budget while drama genre did the worst. Comedy showed the largest range in the box office performance (in log scale). We can rank the movies based on their gross to budget ratio, where a higher ratio implies that the movie did well financially. Note that we do not know the profit or the ROI since we do have the information on the cost other than the budget.

Many of the movies with the highest gross to budget ratio are horror movies. The top entry <em>The Gallows, </em>a low budget horror films about a group of high-school students, has such a high gross to budget ratio compared to the rest of the movies. The unusually high ratio is due to the fact that the movie grossed at about $40 million with a low budget of $100,000. The movie did not do nearly quite well with reviews as it did financially (%14 critic score and %24 audience score from rotten tomatoes). In fact, our data do not show a trend between worldwide gross and review scores.
<h2>Review Scores</h2>
What were the top movies according to reviews? We have two review scores: the critic scores and the audience scores from rotten tomatoes. These scores are percentages of critics and audiences with positive reviews of the movies (2).

Do the critics and audiences usually agree?

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115" src="https://nnvutisa.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/ratings.png" alt="Ratings" width="736" height="644" />

Generally, yes. The critic score and the audience score shows a correlation (with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.77). As you can see however, there is a noticeable scatter. How does the agreement break down between genre?

Audiences generally have a higher percentage of positive reviews especially for action/adventure and drama movies.

Now that we looked at the overall trend, let's focus on the outliers. We can look at movies with the largest disagreements between critic score and audience score.

<h2>So, top movies?</h2>
As we have seen, you can rank movies base on several different criteria. The results are not necessarily in agreements. Even so, I would like to present one last ranking. The data on the worldwide gross, the budget, the critic score, and the audience score were combined in an attempt to find the overall top movies. The final scores were calculated from equally weighting the gross/budget ratio percentile, the audience score, and the critic score. Here is the result of the top 10 movies of 2015 based on this criterion.
